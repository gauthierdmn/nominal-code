## Agent Runners

Nominal Code supports two agent execution backends. The mode is selected automatically based on the execution context.

### Claude Code CLI Runner

Used by **CLI mode** and **webhook server mode**. Wraps the [Claude Code SDK](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-sdk-python) to spawn the Claude Code CLI as a subprocess.

- Streams messages from the CLI process and captures the conversation ID for multi-turn continuity.
- Monkey-patches the SDK message parser to gracefully handle unknown message types (e.g. `rate_limit_event`), preventing the stream from crashing.
- Supports conversation resumption via stored conversation IDs.
- Requires the Claude Code CLI to be installed and on `PATH` (or set via `AGENT_CLI_PATH`).
- Uses the CLI's configured login method — supports Claude Pro and Claude Max subscriptions as an alternative to per-token API billing.
- Captures token usage and cost from the SDK's `ResultMessage` when available.

### LLM Provider API Runner

Used by **CI mode**. Calls the LLM provider API directly with tool use. Supports multiple providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google Gemini, DeepSeek, Groq, Together, Fireworks).

- Implements an agentic loop: sends a prompt, processes `tool_use` blocks by executing tools locally, sends results back, and repeats until the model produces a final text answer or `max_turns` is reached.
- Provides four tools: `Read` (file contents), `Glob` (file search), `Grep` (content search), and `Bash` (shell commands with allowlist validation).
- Does not require the Claude Code CLI — only a provider API key (per-token billing).
- Does not support conversation continuity (each run is stateless).
- Accumulates token usage across all turns and computes dollar cost using a bundled pricing table.

### Runner Selection

| Execution Mode | Agent Runner | Selected By |
|---|---|---|
| CI (`nominal-code ci`) | LLM provider API | `ApiAgentConfig` |
| CLI (`nominal-code review`) | Claude Code CLI | `CliAgentConfig` |
| Webhook server | Claude Code CLI | `CliAgentConfig` |

The dispatcher in `agent/router.py` routes to the appropriate backend based on whether the config is a `CliAgentConfig` or `ApiAgentConfig`.

## Components

### Webhook Server

An [aiohttp](https://docs.aiohttp.org/) application that exposes:

- `GET /health` — returns `{"status": "ok"}`
- `POST /webhooks/{platform}` — one route per enabled platform

Each incoming request is verified, parsed, and dispatched. The HTTP response is returned immediately; actual processing happens asynchronously via the job queue.

### Platform Registry

A factory-based registry where each platform module self-registers at import time. At startup, `build_platforms()` calls each factory and returns only the platforms that are configured (i.e. have their required tokens set).

### Pre-flight Checks (`server/router.py`)

- **`run_pre_flight()`** — central pre-flight for all events. For comment events: validates the author against `ALLOWED_USERS`, logs the event, posts the eyes reaction. For lifecycle events: logs with event type/title/author, posts a PR reaction, and skips auth and comment reaction. Returns whether the job should proceed.

### Job Processing (`jobs/process.py`)

- **`ProcessRunner`** — sets clone URLs on the event, builds the appropriate handler closure, and enqueues jobs for serial execution via the job queue.

### Handlers

- **`handlers.worker.review_and_fix()`** — clones the repo, runs the agent with full tools, posts the reply.
- **`handlers.review.review()`** — core review logic (clone, fetch diff + comments, run agent, parse JSON, filter findings). Returns a `ReviewResult` without posting. Used by webhook, CLI, and CI modes.
- **`handlers.review.review_and_post()`** — webhook entry point. Calls `review()` then posts results to the platform.

### CLI Module (`commands/cli.py`)

- **`_parse_pr_ref()`** — parses `owner/repo#42` into a repo name and PR number.
- **`_build_platform()`** — constructs a platform client from environment tokens (no webhook secret needed).
- **`_run_review()`** — orchestrates the CLI flow: resolve branch, call `review()`, print results, optionally post.

### CI Module (`commands/ci.py`)

- **`run_ci_review()`** — main entry point for CI-triggered reviews. Dispatches to the platform-specific CI module, runs the review, and posts results.
- **`_load_platform_ci()`** — imports the correct platform CI module (`platforms/github/ci.py` or `platforms/gitlab/ci.py`).

### Platform CI Modules (`platforms/{github,gitlab}/ci.py`)

Each platform provides a `ci.py` module with three functions:

- **`build_event()`** — reads CI environment variables and returns a `PullRequestEvent`. GitHub reads `$GITHUB_EVENT_PATH`; GitLab reads `$CI_PROJECT_PATH`, `$CI_MERGE_REQUEST_IID`, etc.
- **`build_platform()`** — constructs a `ReviewerPlatform` from CI tokens (`$GITHUB_TOKEN` or `$GITLAB_TOKEN`).
- **`resolve_workspace()`** — returns the CI runner's checkout directory (`$GITHUB_WORKSPACE` or `$CI_PROJECT_DIR`).

### Agent Runner (`agent/router.py`)

Dispatcher that routes to the API or CLI runner based on the agent config type (`CliAgentConfig` or `ApiAgentConfig`). See [Agent Runners](#agent-runners) above.

### API Runner (`agent/api/runner.py`)

Implements the LLM provider API agentic loop with local tool execution. See [LLM Provider API Runner](#llm-provider-api-runner) above.

### API Tools (`agent/api/tools.py`)

Defines and executes tools for the API runner: `Read`, `Glob`, `Grep`, and `Bash`. Bash commands are validated against an allowlist when `allowed_tools` restricts the agent (e.g. the reviewer is limited to `Bash(git clone*)`).

### CLI Runner (`agent/cli/runner.py`)

Wraps the Claude Code SDK to stream messages from the CLI subprocess. See [Claude Code CLI Runner](#claude-code-cli-runner) above.

### Prompt Composition (`agent/prompts.py`)

Loads and composes the system prompt from multiple sources: the bot's base prompt, global coding guidelines, and per-repo/per-language overrides from the `.nominal/` directory. Language detection is based on file extensions in the PR diff.

### Conversation Tracking (`agent/cli/session.py`)

Bridges the conversation store and the agent runner. Looks up the existing conversation ID for a PR/bot pair, passes it to the agent for multi-turn continuity, and stores the new conversation ID after execution. Only used in webhook mode (CLI and CI are stateless).

### Conversation Store and Job Queue (`conversation/memory.py`, `agent/cli/queue.py`)

- **ConversationStore** — a unified in-memory store with two parallel dicts keyed by `(platform, repo, pr_number, bot_type)`: lightweight conversation IDs and full message histories (API mode only). Used to resume conversations across multiple interactions on the same PR.
- **JobQueue** — per-PR async job queue. Each PR key gets its own `asyncio.Queue` with a single consumer task, ensuring that agent invocations on the same PR run serially (no race conditions). The consumer and queue are cleaned up when drained.

### Cost Tracking (`llm/cost.py`)

Both agent runners capture token usage and compute dollar costs per invocation:

- **Pricing data** — a bundled `llm/data/pricing.json` file maps model IDs to per-token rates (input, output, cache write, cache read). Generated from the [LiteLLM community pricing database](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm/blob/main/model_prices_and_context_window.json) by `scripts/update_pricing.py` and auto-updated weekly via a GitHub Actions workflow.
- **API runner** — accumulates `TokenUsage` from each provider response across the agentic loop, then calls `build_cost_summary()` to compute the total cost.
- **CLI runner** — extracts `total_cost_usd` and token usage from the SDK's `ResultMessage`.
- **Output** — cost is attached to `AgentResult.cost` and `ReviewResult.cost`, logged by the review handler, and formatted for CI output.

### Git Workspace (`workspace/git.py`)

Manages per-PR cloned repositories. Handles initial cloning, updating (fetch + reset), pushing changes, and provides a shared `.deps/` directory for private dependency cloning.

### Workspace Setup (`workspace/setup.py`)

Helper functions for branch resolution and workspace construction. `resolve_branch()` fetches the PR branch from the platform API when the webhook payload doesn't include it. `create_workspace()` and `setup_workspace()` construct and initialise `GitWorkspace` instances.

### Workspace Cleaner (`workspace/cleanup.py`)

A background task that periodically scans the workspace directory and deletes workspaces for PRs that are no longer open. Queries each configured platform's API to check PR state. On API failure, workspaces are kept (safe default). Also cleans up orphaned `.deps/` directories and empty parent directories.

### Error Handling (`agent/errors.py`)

An async context manager (`handle_agent_errors()`) that wraps handler execution. Catches workspace setup failures and agent runtime errors, posts user-facing error messages to the platform, and prevents unhandled exceptions from crashing the event loop.

## Workspace Directory Layout

```
{WORKSPACE_BASE_DIR}/
└── {owner}/
    └── {repo}/
        ├── .deps/           ← shared private dependency clones
        ├── pr-1/            ← workspace for PR #1
        ├── pr-2/            ← workspace for PR #2
        └── pr-N/
```

Each `pr-{N}` directory is a shallow clone of the repository checked out to the PR's head branch.

In CI mode, the workspace is the CI runner's checkout directory (e.g. `$GITHUB_WORKSPACE` or `$CI_PROJECT_DIR`) — no cloning is needed.

## Job Queue

The job queue ensures that only one agent runs per PR at a time. This prevents race conditions when multiple comments arrive in quick succession on the same PR.

Jobs are keyed by `(platform_name, repo_full_name, pr_number, bot_type)`. When a job is enqueued:

1. If no queue exists for that key, one is created along with a consumer task.
2. The job is put into the queue.
3. The consumer processes jobs serially, one at a time.
4. When the queue drains, the consumer task and queue are cleaned up.

## Cleanup Loop

The workspace cleaner lifecycle:

1. **Startup** — `run_once()` immediately removes stale workspaces from a previous run.
2. **Periodic** — `start()` launches a background task that sleeps for `CLEANUP_INTERVAL_HOURS`, then runs cleanup, and repeats.
3. **Shutdown** — the background task is cancelled when the server stops.

Set `CLEANUP_INTERVAL_HOURS=0` to disable the periodic loop entirely.
